# UCLA QCBio Collaboratory workshop W28: Advanced Data Visualization with ggplot2
Author: Wenbin Guo \
Last Update: 2024 Spring

## Description
This interactive and hands-on training will bring up the art and science of data visualization. In this workshop, we will use `R` and journey through the essentials of data wrangling with `dplyr`, followed by a deep dive into the powerful `ggplot2` package (https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) and its extensions. Besides technical skills, attendees will also learn the best practices and principles for creating efficient and effective visualizations. For registration information, please refer to this [link](https://qcb.ucla.edu/collaboratory/workshops)


## Schedule
 The workshop is taught every quarter (3-day workshop, 3 hours per day).

Day 1: Introduction to data wrangling and visualization
- R/RStudio environment setup
- Overview of data visualization: key concepts and workflow
- Data manipulation and transformation with `dplyr`
- Introduction to `ggplot2` and the grammar of graphics
- Hands-on exercises with `dplyr` and `ggplot2`


Day 2: In-depth exploration of `ggplot2`
- Aesthetics, visual elements, and geometric objects
- Layer components and varous types of plots
- Scales (size, shape, colour, position) control
- Coordinate systems and facets 
- Creating basic plots with `ggplot2`: histogram, bar chart, boxplot, scatter plot, etc.


Day 3: Customization and advanced topics in `ggplot2`
