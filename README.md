# UCLA QCBio Collaboratory workshop W28: Advanced Data Visualization with ggplot2
Author: Wenbin Guo \
Last Update: 2024 Spring

## Description
This interactive and hands-on training is tailored for students and researchers eager to delve into the art and science of data visualization. In this workshop, we will use `R` and journey through the essentials of data wrangling with `dplyr`, followed by a deep dive into the powerful `ggplot2` package (https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) and its extensions. By the end of the workshop, participants will gain practical experience with the tools and explore the vast possibilities of data visualization in R. Besides mastering the technical skills, attendees will also learn the best practices and key principles for creating efficient and effective visualizations.

## Schedule
 The workshop is taught every quarter (3-day workshop, 3 hours per day).

Day 1: Introduction to data visualization and ggplot2
- R/RStudio environment setup
- Overview of data visualization: key concepts and workflow
- Data manipulation and transformation with dplyr
- Introduction to ggplot2 and the grammar of graphics
- Hands-on exercises with dplyr and ggplot2


Day 2: In-depth exploration of ggplot2
- Aesthetics and visual elements
- Geometric objects, layer components, and plot types
- Scales (size, shape, colour, position) control
- Coordinate systems and faceting 
- Creating Basic Plots types with ggplot2: histogram, bar chart, boxplot, scatter plot, etc.


Day 3: Advanced topics and customizations in ggplot2
- Customizing Titles, Axes, Legends, and themes
- Principles of Data Visualization and Best Practices
- Exploring ggplot2 Extension Packages 
- Building Complex Visualizations with ggplot2


## Requirements
### Technical: 
R/RStudio  
### Prerequisite:
Participants should have a basic understanding of R programming. Familiarity with basic data structures in R, such as factors, vectors, and data frames, will be beneficial.
