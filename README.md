Author: Wenbin Guo \
Last Update: 2024 Fall


## Description
This advanced workshop provides a comprehensive introduction to data visualization in R, with a focus on mastering `ggplot2` (https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) to create effective, insightful graphics. Tailored for participants with a foundational knowledge of `R`, the workshop covers topics like data wrangling, visualization principles, and advanced techniques to customize and expand visualizations. Participants will gain hands-on experience and explore the art and science of visualization, learning to manipulate data and create plots that are clear, accurate, and visually engaging.
